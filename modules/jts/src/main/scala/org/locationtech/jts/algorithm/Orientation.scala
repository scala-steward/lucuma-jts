        * MD - 9 Aug 2010 It seems that the basic algorithm is slightly orientation
        * dependent, when computing the orientation of a point very close to a
        * line. This is possibly due to the arithmetic in the translation to the
        * origin.
        *
        * For instance, the following situation produces identical results in spite
        * of the inverse orientation of the line segment:
        *
        * Coordinate p0 = new Coordinate(219.3649559090992, 140.84159161824724);

        * Coordinate p = new Coordinate(186.80814046338352, 46.28973405831556); int
        * orient = orientationIndex(p0, p1, p); int orientInv =
        * orientationIndex(p1, p0, p);
        *
        * A way to force consistent results is to normalize the orientation of the
        * vector using the following code. However, this may make the results of
        * orientationIndex inconsistent through the triangle of points, so it's not
        * clear this is an appropriate patch.
