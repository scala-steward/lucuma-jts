/**
 * Represents a directed component of an edge in an {@link EdgeGraph}.
 * HalfEdges link vertices whose locations are defined by {@link Coordinate}s.
 * HalfEdges start at an <b>origin</b> vertex,
 * and terminate at a <b>destination</b> vertex.
 * HalfEdges always occur in symmetric pairs, with the {@link #sym()} method
 * giving access to the oppositely-oriented component.
 * HalfEdges and the methods on them form an edge algebra,
 * which can be used to traverse and query the topology
 * of the graph formed by the edges.
 * <p>
 * To support graphs where the edges are sequences of coordinates
 * each edge may also have a direction point supplied.
 * This is used to determine the ordering
 * of the edges around the origin.
 * HalfEdges with the same origin are ordered
 * so that the ring of edges formed by them is oriented CCW.
 * <p>
 * By design HalfEdges carry minimal information
 * about the actual usage of the graph they represent.
 * They can be subclassed to carry more information if required.
 * <p>
 * HalfEdges form a complete and consistent data structure by themselves,
 * but an {@link EdgeGraph} is useful to allow retrieving edges
 * by vertex and edge location, as well as ensuring
 * edges are created and linked appropriately.
