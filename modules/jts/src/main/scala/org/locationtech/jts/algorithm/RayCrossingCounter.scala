/**
 * Counts the number of segments crossed by a horizontal ray extending to the right
 * from a given point, in an incremental fashion.
 * This can be used to determine whether a point lies in a {link Polygonal} geometry.
 * The class determines the situation where the point lies exactly on a segment.
 * When being used for Point-In-Polygon determination, this case allows short-circuiting
 * the evaluation.
 * <p>
 * This class handles polygonal geometries with any number of shells and holes.
 * The orientation of the shell and hole rings is unimportant.
 * In order to compute a correct location for a given polygonal geometry,
 * it is essential that <b>all</b> segments are counted which
 * <ul>
 * <li>touch the ray
 * <li>lie in in any ring which may contain the point
 * </ul>
 * The only exception is when the point-on-segment situation is detected, in which
 * case no further processing is required.
 * The implication of the above rule is that segments
 * which can be a priori determined to <i>not</i> touch the ray
 * (i.e. by a test of their bounding box or Y-extent)
 * do not need to be counted.  This allows for optimization by indexing.
 * <p>
 * This implementation uses the extended-precision orientation test,
 * to provide maximum robustness and consistency within
 * other algorithms.
