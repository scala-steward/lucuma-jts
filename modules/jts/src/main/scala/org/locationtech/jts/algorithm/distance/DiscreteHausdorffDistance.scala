/**
 * An algorithm for computing a distance metric
 * which is an approximation to the Hausdorff Distance
 * based on a discretization of the input {@link Geometry}.
 * The algorithm computes the Hausdorff distance restricted to discrete points
 * for one of the geometries.
 * The points can be either the vertices of the geometries (the default),
 * or the geometries with line segments densified by a given fraction.
 * Also determines two points of the Geometries which are separated by the computed distance.
 * <p>
 * This algorithm is an approximation to the standard Hausdorff distance.
 * Specifically,
 * <pre>
 * for all geometries a, b:    DHD(a, b) &lt;= HD(a, b)
 * </pre>
 * The approximation can be made as close as needed by densifying the input geometries.
 * In the limit, this value will approach the true Hausdorff distance:
 * <pre>
 * DHD(A, B, densifyFactor) -&gt; HD(A, B) as densifyFactor -&gt; 0.0
 * </pre>
 * The default approximation is exact or close enough for a large subset of useful cases.
 * Examples of these are:
 * <ul>
 * <li>computing distance between Linestrings that are roughly parallel to each other,
 * and roughly equal in length.  This occurs in matching linear networks.
 * <li>Testing similarity of geometries.
 * </ul>
 * An example where the default approximation is not close is:
 * <pre>
 * A = LINESTRING (0 0, 100 0, 10 100, 10 100)
 * B = LINESTRING (0 100, 0 10, 80 10)
 *
 * DHD(A, B) = 22.360679774997898
 * HD(A, B) ~= 47.8
 * </pre>
