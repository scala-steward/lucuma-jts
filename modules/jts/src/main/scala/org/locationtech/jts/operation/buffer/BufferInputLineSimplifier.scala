/**
 * Simplifies a buffer input line to
 * remove concavities with shallow depth.
 * <p>
 * The most important benefit of doing this
 * is to reduce the number of points and the complexity of
 * shape which will be buffered.
 * It also reduces the risk of gores created by
 * the quantized fillet arcs (although this issue
 * should be eliminated in any case by the
 * offset curve generation logic).
 * <p>
 * A key aspect of the simplification is that it
 * affects inside (concave or inward) corners only.
 * Convex (outward) corners are preserved, since they
 * are required to ensure that the generated buffer curve
 * lies at the correct distance from the input geometry.
 * <p>
 * Another important heuristic used is that the end segments
 * of the input are never simplified.  This ensures that
 * the client buffer code is able to generate end caps faithfully.
 * <p>
 * No attempt is made to avoid self-intersections in the output.
 * This is acceptable for use for generating a buffer offset curve,
 * since the buffer algorithm is insensitive to invalid polygonal
 * geometry.  However,
 * this means that this algorithm
 * cannot be used as a general-purpose polygon simplification technique.
