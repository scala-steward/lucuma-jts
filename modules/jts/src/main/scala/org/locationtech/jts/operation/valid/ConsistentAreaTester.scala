/**
 * Checks that a {@link GeometryGraph} representing an area
 * (a {@link Polygon} or {@link MultiPolygon} )
 * has consistent semantics for area geometries.
 * This check is required for any reasonable polygonal model
 * (including the OGC-SFS model, as well as models which allow ring self-intersection at single points)
 * <p>
 * Checks include:
 * <ul>
 * <li>test for rings which properly intersect
 * (but not for ring self-intersection, or intersections at vertices)
 * <li>test for consistent labelling at all node points
 * (this detects vertex intersections with invalid topology,
 * i.e. where the exterior side of an edge lies in the interior of the area)
 * <li>test for duplicate rings
 * </ul>
 * If an inconsistency is found the location of the problem
 * is recorded and is available to the caller.
