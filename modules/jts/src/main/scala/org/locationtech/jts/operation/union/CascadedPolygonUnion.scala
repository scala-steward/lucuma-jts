/**
 * Provides an efficient method of unioning a collection of
 * {@link Polygonal} geometries.
 * The geometries are indexed using a spatial index,
 * and unioned recursively in index order.
 * For geometries with a high degree of overlap,
 * this has the effect of reducing the number of vertices
 * early in the process, which increases speed
 * and robustness.
 * <p>
 * This algorithm is faster and more robust than
 * the simple iterated approach of
 * repeatedly unioning each polygon to a result geometry.
 * <p>
 * The <tt>buffer(0)</tt> trick is sometimes faster, but can be less robust and
 * can sometimes take a long time to complete.
 * This is particularly the case where there is a high degree of overlap
 * between the polygons.  In this case, <tt>buffer(0)</tt> is forced to compute
 * with <i>all</i> line segments from the outset,
 * whereas cascading can eliminate many segments
 * at each stage of processing.
 * The best situation for using <tt>buffer(0)</tt> is the trivial case
 * where there is <i>no</i> overlap between the input geometries.
 * However, this case is likely rare in practice.
